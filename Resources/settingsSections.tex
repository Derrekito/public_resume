%
% hcommandi is the sectioning command to be redefined, i. e., \part, \chapter, \section,
% \subsection, \subsubsection, \paragraph or 
% \subparagraph.
% The paragraph shape is set by hshapei
% hformati is the format to be applied to the whole titleâ€”label and text. This part can contain
% vertical material (and horizontal with some shapes) which is typeset just after the space above the title.
% The label is defined in hlabeli. You may leave it empty if there is no section label at that level, but
% this is not recommended because by doing so the number is not suppressed in the table of contents and running heads.
% hsepi is the horizontal separation between label and title body and must be a length (it must not be empty). This space is vertical in display shape; in frame it is the distance from text to frame.
% Both hlabeli and hsepi are ignored in starred versions of sectioning commands. If you are using picture and the like, set this parameter to 0 pt.
% hbefore-codei is code preceding the title body. The very last command can take an argument,
% which is the title text.7 However, with the package option explicit the title must be given explicitly with #1 (see below).
% hafter-codei is code following the title body. The typeset material is in vertical mode with hang,
% block and display; in horizontal mode with runin and leftmargin (2.7 with the latter, at the beginning of the paragraph). Otherwise is ignored.
